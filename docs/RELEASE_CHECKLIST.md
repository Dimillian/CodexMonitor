# Release Checklist

Use this checklist for every production release.

## 1. Pre-flight

- Confirm `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` and `package.json` versions match.
- Confirm CI is green on `main`.
- Confirm release secrets/variables are configured (Apple signing/notary, Tauri signer, optional Homebrew tap token).

## 2. Trigger release workflow

- Go to **Actions** > **Release**.
- Run on `main`.

## 3. Verify generated assets

- macOS: signed `.dmg`, updater `.app.tar.gz` + `.sig`, and `.zip`.
- Linux: `.AppImage` (+ signature when generated by Tauri) and `.rpm` bundles.
- Windows: installer `.exe`, `.msi`, and portable `.zip`.
- Integrity: `SHA256SUMS.txt` exists and includes release binaries.
- Updater: `latest.json` exists.

## 4. Post-release checks

- Open the GitHub release and confirm all assets were uploaded.
- Download one Windows installer and one portable zip and smoke-test startup.
- Confirm Homebrew tap sync ran (or intentionally skipped if token not configured).
- Confirm the version-bump PR was opened automatically.
