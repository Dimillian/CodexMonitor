# CodexMonitor Claude Context

Use `AGENTS.md` as the primary repository contract.

Canonical AI contract:

- `docs/ai/agent-contract.md`

Claude-specific notes:

1. Keep responses and edits aligned to repository architecture rules in `AGENTS.md`.
2. Prefer minimal, surgical changes.
3. Keep documentation synchronized with behavior changes in the same PR.
